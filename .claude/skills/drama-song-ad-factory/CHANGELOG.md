# Changelog: drama-song-ad-factory

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-06

Initial release: the Claude-Nine / Claude Code distribution of the BlackCEO
drama-song ad factory, built to directive section 2.2 (skill shape),
section 26 (both runtime adapters, one control entrypoint), and
section 35.2 (999 distribution process).

- Skill shape: `SKILL.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`,
  `references/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `assets/`, and the two runtime
  adapters `adapters/claude-nine/README.md` +
  `adapters/claude-code/README.md`. One skill folder; no second config root,
  no independently maintained duplicate.
- Same CLI as the OpenClaw distribution (W3-02): `scripts/core/` is a
  byte-identical packaged copy of
  `onboarding/75-drama-song-ad-factory/scripts/core/` — 15 files, tree
  sha256 `ccaacbfedc4d33cf47408fc1f7cdbb696b40e6be0341e0652294153a2fab419d`
  on both sides at packaging time (`__pycache__` excluded). Entrypoint:
  `scripts/core/intake_preflight/factory.py` (`intake` / `preflight`,
  JSON envelope, exit codes 0/1/2/3/4).
- References: `references/cli-contract.md` (envelope, arguments, reason
  codes, live-verified results) and `references/parity-contract.md`
  (what must match across distributions, source path, re-sync procedure).
- Registry: registered in `CONTROL/bundled-skills.txt` alongside
  `motion-video-plus`, so source presence becomes automatic installation
  (directive 2.4). `CONTROL/bundled-components.json` is release-manifest
  territory and is intentionally not touched by this unit.
- Tests: `tests/test_cli_smoke.py` (packaged CLI behavior) and
  `tests/test_parity_layout.py` (layout, registry, adapter hygiene,
  byte parity with the canonical core; reports `PARITY UNDETERMINED` when
  the canonical tree is absent instead of claiming a pass).
- Runtime: Claude-Nine adapter follows router laws and live catalog
  resolution with no hardcoded model table; plain Claude Code adapter keeps
  `claude` non-routed and never sets a separate config directory.
